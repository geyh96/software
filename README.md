#### The Lq-norm learning for ultrahigh-dimensional survival data: an integrated framework
* The Lq-norm learning is proposed to detect predictors with various levels of impact, such as short- or long-term impact, on censored
outcome.

#### Integrated powered density (IPOD): screening ultrahigh dimensional covariates with survival outcome
 *  With a flexible weighting scheme, Kolmogorov statistic as a special case,  IPOD method can detect early or late impact on censored outcome.

#### Conditional screening for survival data
 * The recently developed variable screening methods, though powerful in many practical setting,  are less powerful in detecting marginally weak while jointly important signals. A new conditional screening method for survival outcome data computes the marginal contribution of each biomarker given priorly known biological information.

#### Quantile adaptive model-free variable screening for high-dimensional heterogeneous data
 * The propsoed nonlinear independence screening procedure employs spline approximations to model the marginal effects at a quantile level of interest.
